# Nuboard-theme

[**Nuboard-theme**](https://rajanyadav.me) is a minimal, responsive, and powerful  Jekyll theme and is the best suite for your podcast, case study, and project showcase.

To use it, you must first clone it on your system or [download](https://github.com/hatchedland/nuboard-theme/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) the zip file.

## Prerequisite
To use it, you must first have the latter dependencies installed.
-   [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) version **2.5.0** or higher, including all development headers (check your Ruby version using `ruby -v`)
-   [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/pages/download) (check your Gems version using `gem -v`)
-   [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/install/) and [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) (check versions using `gcc -v`,`g++ -v`, and `make -v`)


## Installation
```console
bundle
```
This command installs the Gems mentioned in your `Gemfile.lock.`

bundle exec jekyll serve
```

> **_NOTE:_**  If you are using Ruby version 3.0.0 or higher, step 5 [may fail](https://github.com/github/pages-gem/issues/752). You may fix it by adding `webrick` to your dependencies: `bundle add webrick`
